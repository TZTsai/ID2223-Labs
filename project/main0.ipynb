We model the stock trading process as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). We then formulate our trading goal as a maximization problem.\n","\n","   The algorithm is trained using Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithms and the components of the reinforcement learning environment are:\n","\n","\n","   * Action: The action space describes the allowed actions that the agent interacts with the\n","   environment. Normally, a ∈ A includes three actions: a ∈ {−1, 0, 1}, where −1, 0, 1 represent\n","   selling, holding, and buying one stock. Also, an action can be carried upon multiple shares. We use\n","   an action space {−k, ..., −1, 0, 1, ..., k}, where k denotes the number of shares. For example, \"Buy\n","   10 shares of AAPL\" or \"Sell 10 shares of AAPL\" are 10 or −10, respectively\n","\n","   * Reward function: r(s, a, s′) is the incentive mechanism for an agent to learn a better action. The change of the portfolio value when action a is taken at state s and arriving at new state s',  i.e., r(s, a, s′) = v′ − v, where v′ and v represent the portfolio\n","   values at state s′ and s, respectively\n","\n","   * State: The state space describes the observations that the agent receives from the environment. Just as a human trader needs to analyze various information before executing a trade, so\n","   our trading agent observes many different features to better learn in an interactive environment.\n","\n","   * Environment: Dow 30 consituents\n","\n","\n","   The data of the single stock that we will be using for this case study is obtained from Yahoo Finance API.

Design Environment\n","   Considering the stochastic and interactive nature of the automated stock trading tasks, a financial task is modeled as a **Markov Decision Process (MDP)** problem. The training process involves observing stock price change, taking an action and reward's calculation to have the agent adjusting its strategy accordingly. By interacting with the environment, the trading agent will derive a trading strategy with the maximized rewards as time proceeds.\n","\n","   Our trading environments, based on OpenAI Gym framework, simulate live stock markets with real market data according to the principle of time-driven simulation.\n","\n","   The action space describes the allowed actions that the agent interacts with the environment. Normally, action a includes three actions: {-1, 0, 1}, where -1, 0, 1 represent selling, holding, and buying one share. Also, an action can be carried upon multiple shares. We use an action space {-k,…,-1, 0, 1, …, k}, where k denotes the number of shares to buy and -k denotes the number of shares to sell. For example, \"Buy 10 shares of AAPL\" or \"Sell 10 shares of AAPL\" are 10 or -10, respectively. The continuous action space needs to be normalized to [-1, 1], since the policy is defined on a Gaussian distribution, which needs to be normalized and symmetric."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":9,"metadata":{},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["83897\n","9773\n"]}],"source":["train = data_split(processed_full,
